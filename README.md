# Sinatra with SQL CRUD

We're building the next hot fish favoriting site; fish.ly. Google, Apple, IBM, and anyone who's anyone is entering this market; we have to move fast. For our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) the site needs to let users register, create fish, and favorite other people's fish. If this is shipped by the end of this week, we close a $20m round at a $300m valuation; just enough to feed our families!

Since someone decided that more engineers means more throughput, I've made the executive decision to have you all work in pairs and produce the same application 13 times. Of course, as your engineering manager, I know this isn't true, but hey who am I to disagree with the people writing the checks; you all have a job, so be thankful. When it's all said and done I'll tell 'em we all worked hard to produce a single version of their vision, but we all know Google's going to beat us anyways. I heard they have a fish favoriting watch or something.

Anyways, back to the application!
